# Readme
Linear_Data.ipynb contains my code, data, and graphs

The two csv files contain my data before and after I mess with it

# Thoughts
It's interesting how the linear one has a better line of best fit compared to the square root as measured by r^2. 
This is the opposite of what we would expect
